# LifetimeArt - Home Improvement Website

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project showcasing a modern home improvement company website with advanced animations and responsive design.

## Key Features

### Mobile-First Animation Approach

• **Performance-Optimized Animations**: Used CSS exclusively with Framer Motion to ensure smooth animations on mobile devices.

• **Conditional Animation Logic**: Implemented responsive animation strategies reduce cognitive load and improve touch interactions.

• **Reduced Motion Considerations**: Implemented animation durations to maintain accessibility standards while providing sufficient visual feedback, ensuring animations feel responsive rather than sluggish on mobile devices.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
